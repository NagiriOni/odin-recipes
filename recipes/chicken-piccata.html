        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>2 chicken breast, skinless + boneless</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt + more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper + more to taste</li>
            <li>1 Cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp capers, drained</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>¾ Cup chicken stock, preferably homemade</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp unsalted butter, cold + cubed</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>½ lb capellini, spaghetti, or angel hair pasta, cooked al dente</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>

            <li>Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally leaving a thin piece of connected meat to keep the halves connected, 
                the result will be two thinner chicken cutlets. Season each with salt and peppers.</li>
            <li>Dredge the chicken in the flour and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pan.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the preheated skillet and cook for 4-5 minutes per side or until crispy and browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the pan and reserve on a plate.</li>
            <li>Add the capers to the same pan used for cooking the chicken, cook them for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Deglaze the pan with chicken stock and lemon juice. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until the sauce has reduced by about 50 percent.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat off and add the butter. Stir the sauce constantly until all the butter has melted.</li>
            <li>Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken back to the sauce and cook for 3 minutes or until the chicken is reheated.</li>
            <li>Serve the chicken piccata with the pasta of your choice.</li>
