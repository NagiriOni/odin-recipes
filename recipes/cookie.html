        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Listen, chocolate chip cookies are out and everything cookies are in - as in, everything is in this cookie!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz (226 g) browned butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>9.75 oz (276 g) light brown sugar</li>
            <li>4.5 oz (127 g) granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>11.5 oz  (326 g) all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp hazelnut coffee grounds, finely ground</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>16 oz  (453 g) inclusions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>

            <li>Combine the browned butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer. Begin creaming the butter and sugar, 
                using a paddle attachment, at medium-high speed. Continue mixing until the butter becomes soft, aerated, 
                and fully combined with the sugars, about 1-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure the mixture is homogeneous.</li>
            <li>Start adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing thoroughly in between additions. Make sure to scrape down 
                the bowl in between additions as well. This will ensure the entire mixture is well combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, coffee grounds, baking soda, and baking powder. Whisk to evenly 
                distribute the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients all at once to the mixing bowl, then mix at low speed until the batter is just combined. 
                Overmixing the dough at this stage can result in unwanted gluten development.</li>
            <li>Combine the dough with the inclusions/toppings of your choice. Once again, avoid overmixing the dough.</li>
            <li>Using an ice cream scoop, scoop the dough into mounds. Place them evenly on a large, rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the dough overnight or up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies at 375°F for 18-20 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.</li>
            <li>Tansfer the still hot cookie to a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>

        </ol>
