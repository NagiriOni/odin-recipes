        <p><em>Cheese and Guava Filling</em></p>
        <ul>

            <li>6 oz guava paste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p><em>Empanadas Method:</em></p>
        <ol>

            <li>Combine the flour and salt in a large heat-proof bowl. Whisk to combine the dry ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add the fat of choice and stir to combine by hand or using a plastic spatula until the dough resembles coarse sand.</li>
            <li>Add about ⅔ of the water and mix the dough until the water is completely combined. Add more water as necessary until the 
                dough is fully hydrated but not at all sticky.</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough until it is smooth and 
                elastic, about 4-5 minutes. Alternatively, knead the dough in a kitchen aid mixer, using a dough hook attachment, for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the dough back into the mixing bowl and cover with a plate or clean dish towel. Allow the dough to rest for 15-20 minutes at 
                room temperature. This will help relax the gluten before rolling the dough out.</li>
            <li>Place the rested dough back onto the lightly floured work surface. Shape the dough into a rough log shape.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough log into 18 equal portions, then shape them into balls. Using a rolling pin, roll each dough ball out into a round 
                that is 5-6 inches wide in diameter and ⅛-⅙ inch thick. Stack the dough rounds with pieces of parchment in between for short-term 
                storage. Optionally, tightly wrap the stack of empanada dough rounds in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for 
                up to 3 months.</li>
            <li>Fill each of the dough rounds with about 2 tablespoons of your filling of choice, then dip one finger in water and run it along the 
                edge of each round. Fold the dough rounds in half, encapsulating the filling. Make sure to press out any air bubbles before sealing the edge.</li>
            <li>Crimp the open end of the empanadas with a fork or by folding the edge inwards starting at one end of the crescent and moving towards the other 
                side until the seam is entirely sealed.</li>
            <li>Add about 2 ½ -3 inches of oil to a large high-sided skillet. Preheat the oil to 400 °F and fry for 4-6 minutes or until golden brown, puffed, 
                and cooked through. Transfer the fried empanadas to a paper towel-lined sheet tray.</li>
            <li> ** For freezing: fry the empanadas until they are about 75% of the way done, about 1-2 minutes less, then allow them to cool to room temperature. 
                Place the empanadas in an airtight container or wrap each individually in plastic wrap. Freeze the par-cooked empanadas for up to 3 months. 
                To reheat the empanadas, preheat the oven to 375 °F. Place the frozen empanadas on a baking rack placed in a large rimmed baking sheet. 
                Bake the empanadas for 10-12 minutes or until cooked through, golden brown, and crispy. **</li>
            <li>Allow the empanadas to cool for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>

        </ol>

        <p><em>Beef Filling Method:</em></p>
        <ol>

            <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and heat over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds or until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the annatto (or sweet paprika), cumin, and oregano to the pan and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef to the pan, breaking up any large chunks. Allow the beef to cook undisturbed 
                for 3-4 minutes, then break up any remaining pieces. Stir to combine the beef with the onion mixture 
                and continue cooking until the beef is cooked through, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season the mixture to taste with salt and pepper, then stir in the chopped eggs. Allow the mixture to 
                cool to room temperature before using.</li>

        </ol>

        <p><em>Cheese and Guava Method:</em></p>
        <ol>

            <li>Slice the queso blanco into ⅓ inch by 2 inch pieces. Cut the guava paste into ½ inch by 1 inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Reserve in the refrigerator until ready to use. When filling the empanadas, add 1-2 slices of the cheese and guava 
                pieces to the center of each dough round.</li>

        </ol>
